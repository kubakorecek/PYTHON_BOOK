    This is to exc. 2 in ch.1.

    We should create program that as a n input take numbers and calculate count, sum , min, max , mean.

    The solution is mine and is free to use any other student or school for learning Python.


"""

def Calculator():
    """
    This is just calculator which print all numbers into command line. There will be no input or return.

    Since, this is more learning, we do not use sum, min, max as built in function, instead we will find it manually.
    The only built in function to used is len()

    At first, we will have to order our list.

    We use build in function sort. The last and first member of list give us max resp min of the list.

    For sum, we use loop.
